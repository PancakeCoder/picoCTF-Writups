Reading through the code keygenme-trial.py, you can see how the key is checked.

Use the check_key function to put together the key
We already know the two static parts of the key.
Create Decode.py to generate the dynamic part.
Use the positions of the sha256 of "MORTON" given in check_key.

key = picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_75fc1081}
