Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help!

The description hints at using the bash script on the static. After using wget and chmod, I executed
./ltdis.sh static
to produce two text files.
Running them through grep picoCTF, I found the flag, picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_f6c48608}

I could have also reached the flag using
strings static | grep picoCTF
